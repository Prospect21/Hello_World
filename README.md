# Hello_World
Hello World

My frist hello world

initially we created a new project in android studio

When I did see the first layaout a hello world appears by default.

I made a couple of changes, such as the font size and color, 
also I placed another textview in the lower left with my name.

To run the application, connect my cell phone via USB and at the moment that Android studio read it, 
I could compile the apk on my phone
